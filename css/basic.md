<b>CSS Box Model üì¶</b>
</summary>
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of:

1. **Content**: This is where your actual text, images, or other media are located. The size of the content box can be changed using the `width` and `height` properties.
2. **Padding**: This clears an area around the content, inside the border. The padding is affected by the background color of the box.
3. **Border**: This goes around the padding and content. The border is affected by the background color of the box.
4. **Margin**: This clears an area outside the border. The margin does not have a background color, it is completely transparent.

The total width and height of an element can be calculated as follows:

- Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin.
- Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin.

For example, if you have a paragraph element defined as follows:

```css
p {
  width: 80px;
  height: 70px;
  margin: 0;
  border: 2px solid black;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

The total width for the element can be calculated as: Total width = 80px (width) + 10px (left padding + right padding) + 4px (left border + right border) + 0px (left margin + right margin) = 94px.

The total height for the element can be calculated as: Total height = 70px (height) + 10px (top padding + bottom padding) + 4px (top border + bottom border) + 0px (top margin + bottom margin) = 84px.

<b>How to center a div?</b>
</summary>

To center a `div` in CSS, you can use different methods depending on the situation:

1. **Using Auto Margins**: If the `div` has a specified width, you can use auto left and right margins:

    ```css
    .center-div {
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;
      width: 50%; /* or any specific width */
    }
    ```

2. **Using Flexbox**: You can make the parent element a flex container and then align the `div` to the center both vertically and horizontally:

    ```css
    .parent {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center; /* aligns horizontally */
      align-items: center; /* aligns vertically */
    }
    ```

3. **Using Grid**: Similar to Flexbox, you can make the parent element a grid container and then align the `div` to the center:

    ```css
    .parent {
      display: grid;
      justify-content: center; /* aligns horizontally */
      align-items: center; /* aligns vertically */
    }
    ```

4. **Using Positioning**: If you want to center the `div` within the entire viewport, you can use absolute positioning:

    ```css
    .center-div {
      position: absolute;
      top: 50%;
      left: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    }
    ```

Remember to replace `.center-div` and `.parent` with the actual class name or id of your `div` or its parent element.

<b>CSS Flexbox Design üìê</b>
</summary>

Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a layout model in CSS that allows you to easily design a flexible and efficient layout structure. It's particularly useful for building user interfaces and layouts in one dimension (either a row or a column).

Here are some key properties of Flexbox:

1. **display**: This property is used to define a flex container. The value can be either `flex` or `inline-flex`.

```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```

2. **flex-direction**: This property defines the direction in which flex items are placed in the flex container.

```css
.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
```

3. **flex-wrap**: This property allows the items to wrap as needed.

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

4. **flex-flow**: This is a shorthand property for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.

```css
.container {
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}
```

5. **justify-content**: This property defines the alignment along the main axis.

```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
}
```
These properties make it easier to design a responsive layout without using float or positioning.

<b>CSS Media Queries üì±üíªüñ•Ô∏è</b>
</summary>
Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow content to adapt to different conditions such as screen resolution or device viewport width. They are a key component of responsive design.

Here's a basic syntax of a media query:

```css
@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
  /* CSS-Code; */
}
```

The `@media` rule is followed by:
- `not`, `only` (optional operators), 
- `mediatype` (optional, assumed to be `all` if not specified), and
- `expressions` (conditions that can be either true or false).

If the specified media type matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the media query are true, the media query is considered true and the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied.

For example, the following media query applies the CSS rules if the device's viewport width is 480 pixels or wider:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  /* CSS rules go here */
}
```

In this example, `screen` is the media type and `(min-width: 480px)` is the expression. The CSS rules inside the media query will be applied if the device is a screen and its viewport width is at least 480 pixels.

Media queries are a powerful tool for building responsive websites that look good on different devices and window sizes.

<b>CSS Pseudo-classes üéØ</b>
</summary>

A pseudo-class in CSS is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element. For example, it can be used to:

- Style an element when a user mouses over it
- Style visited and unvisited links differently
- Style an element when it gets focus

The syntax of pseudo-classes is as follows:

```css
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
```

For example, the `:hover` pseudo-class can be used to change the color of a button when the user's pointer hovers over the button:

```css
button:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```

Pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes. When you hover over the link in the example, it will change color:

```css
a.highlight:hover {
  color: #ff0000;
}
```

Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (`:visited`, for example), the status of its content (like `:checked` on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like `:hover`, which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).

<b>how you can use CSS to enhance accessibility?</b>
</summary>

* Separating Content from Presentation

You can use CSS to control the visual layout and appearance of the website without altering the HTML markup. For example:

```html
<div class="content">
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is some sample text.</p>
</div>
```

```css
.content {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
```

* Hiding Content

You can use CSS to hide content that is not relevant or might be distracting for certain users. For example:

```css
.hide {
  display: none;
}
```

* Controlling Visual Layouts

You can use CSS to control character spacing, text alignment, object position on the page, and more. For example:

```css
p {
  text-align: justify;
  letter-spacing: 1.5px;
}
```

* Keyboard Navigation

You can enhance keyboard navigation by providing focus styles that help identify exactly where users are on a webpage. For example:

```css
a:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

* Load CSS Asynchronously

To prevent CSS from blocking the rendering of the page and improve web performance, especially for users with slower internet connections, you can use the `preload` resource hint to load stylesheets. For example:

```html
<link rel="preload" href="styles.css" as="style">
```

* Aural CSS

You can use CSS to control audio and speech output, which can be beneficial for users with visual impairments. For example:

```css
@media speech {
  h1 {
    voice-volume: loud;
    speak: spell-out;
  }
}
```

Remember, while CSS can significantly enhance accessibility, if misused, it can also harm accessibility. Therefore, it's important to follow these best practices when using CSS for web development.

<b>CSS measurement units</b>
</summary>
In CSS, there are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

**Absolute Lengths**:
- `cm`: centimeters
- `mm`: millimeters
- `in`: inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
- `px`: pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
- `pt`: points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
- `pc`: picas (1pc = 12 pt)

Pixels (`px`) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

**Relative Lengths**:
- `em`: Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)
- `ex`: Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)
- `ch`: Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)
- `rem`: Relative to font-size of the root element
- `vw`: Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport
- `vh`: Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
- `vmin`: Relative to 1% of viewport's smaller dimension
- `vmax`: Relative to 1% of viewport's larger dimension
- `%`: Relative to the parent element

These units are used to specify various measurements in your style rules, such as margins, padding, font size, width, height, border, etc. It's important to choose the right unit based on the context to ensure your web pages are accessible and look good on all devices.
