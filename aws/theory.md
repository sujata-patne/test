<b>What is lambda?</b>
</summary>
In the context of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.

AWS Lambda is a compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is an event-driven, serverless computing platform. 

Here's how it works:
- You write your code and upload it as a .zip file or container image.
- AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure.
- It performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging.
- AWS Lambda is triggered by over 200 AWS services and Software as a Service (SaaS) applications.
- You only pay for the compute time you consumeâ€”there is no charge when your code is not running.

AWS Lambda is ideal for application scenarios that need to scale up rapidly, and scale down to zero when not in demand. For example, you can use Lambda for file processing, stream processing, web applications, IoT backends, and mobile backends. 

Please note that when using Lambda, you are responsible only for your code. Lambda manages the compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network, and other resources.

<b>How to differenciate between internal external users using api gateway?</b>
</summary>
In AWS API Gateway, you can differentiate between internal and external users by using different authentication and authorization mechanisms for each type of user. Here's how you can do it:

1. **External Users Authentication**: You can use AWS Cognito in combination with API Gateway to secure your REST API for external users. Here are the steps:
    - Create an AWS Cognito user pool to store and authenticate your users.
    - Create your API Gateway.
    - Integrate API Gateway with Cognito.
    - After a user logs in, you can retrieve a token and use it in the Authorizer header for each of your API calls to confirm that the user is signed in and can use the API.

2. **Internal Microservices**: For internal microservices, you can use IAM roles and grant these roles access to call your API Gateway. Then attach the roles to your EC2 instances or Lambdas. If you want to use the above solution (Authorizer header uses Cognito tokens) in combination with IAM roles, it will not work to call directly the API as it will be blocked by Cognito authorizer. An alternative would be to have 2 APIs connected to the same Lambdas, one for internal usage and one for external.

3. **A Different Approach**: The cleanest solution, in this case, would be to not use Cognito authorizer authentication but instead use AWS_IAM as the authorization method in your API and create a group in AWS Cognito, include all Cognito users to this group, and attach an IAM Role to the group. By doing this, when a Cognito user signs in, they will get temporary access keys through the attached IAM role, and they could call your API. At the same time, when you internally attach this role to your Lambdas, they will have access to your API as well.

Here are some AWS related interview questions/answer for a Node.js developer with 8 years of experience:

1. **Explain how you have used AWS with Node.js in your past projects.**
    - As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have personal experience or past projects. However, I can share how AWS and Node.js are typically used together in a project. AWS provides several services to host Node.js applications, such as EC2 for virtual servers, Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment, and Lambda for serverless computing. AWS offers various data storage options that can be used with Node.js, such as RDS for relational databases, DynamoDB for NoSQL databases, and S3 for object storage. AWS ElastiCache can be used to improve the performance of Node.js applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. AWS Auto Scaling can be used to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances running your Node.js application based on demand. AWS CloudWatch can be used to monitor your Node.js applications and AWS resources in real-time. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can be used to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. AWS API Gateway can be used to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs for your Node.js applications at any scale. AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy can be used to automate the build and deployment processes for your Node.js applications.

2. **What is AWS Lambda and how have you used it in Node.js?**
    - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. You can run your code for virtually any type of application or backend service. Here's how you might use it with Node.js:
        - Event-driven Processing: You could write a Lambda function in Node.js that gets triggered in response to events like changes to data in an S3 bucket, updates to a DynamoDB table, custom events generated by your applications, etc.
        - Real-time File Processing: You could use Lambda to automatically create thumbnails or transcode videos when new files are uploaded to S3. Your Node.js code would be triggered by the file upload event.
        - Real-time Stream Processing: You could use Lambda to process real-time streams of data for application activity tracking, transaction order processing, click stream analysis, data cleansing, metrics generation, log filtering, indexing, social media analysis, and IoT device data telemetry and metering.
        - Compute for Mobile and Web Backends: You could build backends using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway to authenticate and process API requests. Lambda makes it easy to create rich, personalized app experiences.
        - Microservices: You could build your application out of small, single-purpose functions that respond to HTTP requests or API calls. These microservices can be independently deployed and managed.

3. **How do you handle file uploads to AWS S3 in Node.js?**
    - In Node.js, you can use the AWS SDK to handle file uploads to S3. Here's a basic example:
        ```javascript
        var AWS = require('aws-sdk');
        var fs = require('fs');

        // Create an S3 client
        var s3 = new AWS.S3();

        // Read the file from the file system
        var fileStream = fs.createReadStream('fileToUpload.txt');
        fileStream.on('error', function(err) {
          console.log('File Error', err);
        });

        // Create a params object
        var uploadParams = {Bucket: 'myBucket', Key: '', Body: ''};
        uploadParams.Body = fileStream;
        uploadParams.Key = path.basename('fileToUpload.txt');

        // Call S3 to retrieve upload file to specified bucket
        s3.upload (uploadParams, function (err, data) {
          if (err) {
            console.log("Error", err);
          } if (data) {
            console.log("Upload Success", data.Location);
          }
        });
        ```
        This code reads a file from the file system, then uploads it to an S3 bucket.

4. **How would you deploy a Node.js application on AWS?**
    - There are several ways to deploy a Node.js application on AWS, and the best method depends on your specific use case. Here are a few options:
        - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: This is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in multiple languages. To deploy a Node.js application, you would package your application code and dependencies into a ZIP file, and then upload that ZIP file to Elastic Beanstalk. Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, including capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.
        - **AWS EC2**: If you need more control over your environment, you can manually set up a Node.js environment on an EC2 instance. This involves launching an EC2 instance, installing Node.js and any necessary dependencies, and then deploying your application code to the instance.
        - **AWS Lambda**: If you're building a microservices architecture or need to run event-driven workloads, you can package your Node.js application into a Lambda function. You can then set up API Gateway to trigger the function.

5. **Can you explain how connection pooling with AWS RDS and Node.js works?**
    - Connection pooling is a method used to manage the connections between your application and your database to enhance the performance of executing commands on the database. In Node.js, you can use libraries like `pg-pool` for PostgreSQL or `mysql2` for MySQL to manage a pool of connections to your AWS RDS instance. When your application needs to execute a command on the database, it can borrow a connection from the pool, execute the command, and then return the connection to the pool. This is much more efficient than opening a new connection for every command, especially for applications that execute a large number of database commands.

6. **How do you secure AWS API Gateway endpoints that are used in a Node.js application?**
    - AWS API Gateway provides several mechanisms to secure your API endpoints:
        - **IAM Permissions**: You can use AWS IAM to manage access to your API Gateway endpoints. With IAM, you can create policies that allow or deny access to your APIs.
        - **Lambda Authorizers**: You can use Lambda functions to control who can invoke your API. When a client makes a request to your API, API Gateway calls the Lambda authorizer, which takes the caller's identity as input and returns an IAM policy.
        - **Cognito User Pools**: You can use a Cognito user pool to manage user accounts for your API. When a client sends a request to an API method configured with a Cognito user pool authorizer, API Gateway verifies the JWT signature of the bearer token included in the request before allowing the method to be invoked.
        - **Resource Policies**: You can create resource policies to allow or deny access to your APIs from specified source IP address ranges or CIDR blocks, or to allow cross-account access to your APIs.

7. **What are the steps to integrate AWS Cognito for user management in a Node.js application?**
    - Here are the steps to integrate AWS Cognito for user management in a Node.js application:
        - **Set Up the AWS SDK**: Install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js and configure it with your AWS credentials.
        - **Create a User Pool**: Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to create a user pool in Amazon Cognito.
        - **Sign Up Users**: Use the `signUp` method provided by the Amazon Cognito Identity SDK for JavaScript to register a user to the user pool.
        - **Verify Email or Phone Number**: After a user is signed up, they receive a verification code by email or SMS. Use the `confirmSignUp` method to verify the user's email or phone number.
        - **Authenticate Users**: Use the `authenticateUser` method to sign in a user and obtain user pool tokens.
        - **Access Resources with Tokens**: After a user is authenticated, your application can use the user pool tokens to access resources on behalf of the user.

8. **How do you monitor and debug AWS Lambda functions written in Node.js?**
    - AWS provides several tools for monitoring and debugging Lambda functions:
        - **CloudWatch Logs**: By default, AWS Lambda automatically integrates with CloudWatch Logs and pushes all logs from your code to a CloudWatch Logs group associated with a Lambda function.
        - **CloudWatch Metrics**: AWS Lambda automatically publishes metrics for your functions. Metrics include total invocations, errors, duration, throttles, DLQ errors, and iterator age for stream-based invocations.
        - **X-Ray**: You can use AWS X-Ray to trace and analyze user requests as they travel through your Lambda functions to downstream AWS resources.
        - **CloudTrail**: If you want to record all API calls made by or on behalf of a function in your AWS account, you can use AWS CloudTrail.

9. **How do you handle distributed transactions across multiple microservices in AWS?**
    - Handling distributed transactions across multiple microservices in AWS can be challenging because traditional transaction methods, like two-phase commit, may not work in a microservices architecture. Here are a few strategies:
        - **SAGA Pattern**: Instead of using ACID transactions, you can use a series of local transactions where each transaction updates data within a single service. The SAGA pattern sequences these local transactions, and if one transaction fails because it violates a business rule, then the SAGA executes compensating transactions to undo the impact of the preceding transactions.
        - **Event-Driven Architecture**: In this model, state changes in the application data are captured and broadcasted as events. Other services can subscribe to these events and react accordingly.
        - **Two-Phase Commit & AWS Step Functions**: AWS Step Functions makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. You can design and run workflows that stitch together services, such as AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, and Amazon SageMaker, into feature-rich applications. Workflows are made up of a series of steps, with the output of one step acting as input into the next. Application development is simpler and more intuitive using Step Functions, because it translates your workflow into a state machine diagram that is easy to understand, easy to explain to others, and easy to change. You can monitor each step of execution as it happens, which means you can identify and fix problems quickly.
        - **AWS SNS and SQS**: AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queue Service (SQS) can be used to handle asynchronous communication between microservices. If a microservice needs to communicate with another microservice, it can publish a message to an SNS topic, which can then deliver the message to all subscribed endpoints, including SQS queues. Other microservices can poll these SQS queues and process messages at their own pace.

10. **What strategies would you use to migrate a monolithic Node.js application to a serverless architecture on AWS?**
    - Here are some strategies for migrating a monolithic Node.js application to a serverless architecture on AWS:
        - **Identify Independent Components**: The first step in migrating a monolithic application to a serverless architecture is to identify components of the application that can operate independently. These components are good candidates to become individual microservices.
        - **Create Serverless Microservices**: Once you've identified the independent components, you can start creating serverless microservices using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Each microservice should have its own AWS Lambda function, and you can use API Gateway to route requests to the appropriate Lambda function.
        - **Data Migration**: If your monolithic application uses a relational database, you might need to migrate to a different data store that's more suitable for serverless architectures. AWS provides several options, such as DynamoDB for NoSQL, RDS for SQL, or S3 for object storage.
        - **Iterative Migration**: It's usually not feasible to migrate a monolithic application to a serverless architecture all at once. Instead, you can migrate one component at a time. This allows you to gradually shift traffic from your monolithic application to your serverless microservices.
        - **Use AWS SAM or Serverless Framework**: The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application. You can also use the Serverless Framework, an open-source, application framework to develop and deploy serverless applications on AWS and other cloud platforms.
