What is difference between S3 and EC3 AWS?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) are both popular services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), but they serve different purposes and are used for different use cases.

### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):

1. **Purpose:**
   - S3 is an object storage service. It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It's excellent for storing and managing large amounts of unstructured data like images, videos, backups, log files, and more.
  
2. **Use Cases:**
   - Storing and serving static website content.
   - Hosting images and videos for applications.
   - Backup and restore solutions.
   - Data archiving.
   - Big Data analytics and data lakes.
  
3. **Features:**
   - Highly scalable and durable.
   - Data is stored in objects within containers known as "buckets."
   - Access control mechanisms to manage who can access the data.
   - Versioning, logging, and lifecycle policies for data management.
  
4. **Pricing:**
   - Pay-as-you-go model based on the amount of data stored and data transfer out of S3.

### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):

1. **Purpose:**
   - EC2 provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to rent virtual servers (known as instances) and run applications on them. EC2 instances can be customized to meet various computing needs.
  
2. **Use Cases:**
   - Web hosting.
   - Application development and testing.
   - Running enterprise applications.
   - High-performance computing.
   - Machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks.
  
3. **Features:**
   - Various instance types optimized for different workloads (e.g., general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, etc.).
   - Ability to choose different operating systems and configure virtual hardware.
   - Auto Scaling and Load Balancing for high availability and scalability.
   - Integration with other AWS services.
  
4. **Pricing:**
   - Pay-as-you-go model based on the type of EC2 instances used, data transfer, and optional features like Elastic IP addresses and provisioned IOPS for storage.

**Key Differences:**

- **Use Case:** S3 is for storing and retrieving large volumes of data, while EC2 is for running virtual servers and applications.

- **Storage vs. Compute:** S3 is primarily a storage service, while EC2 provides virtual computing resources.

- **Management:** EC2 instances require management like traditional servers (e.g., OS updates, security configurations), whereas S3 handles storage without the need for server management.

- **Scalability:** S3 automatically scales to handle large amounts of data. EC2 instances can be manually or automatically scaled based on workload requirements.

In summary, if you need scalable, durable storage for objects and files, S3 is the choice. If you need scalable compute capacity to run applications or services, EC2 instances are more suitable. Often, applications use both services together for storing data (S3) and processing it (EC2).
